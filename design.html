The stages of property development
Although there are a distinct set of complementary steps that every property developer must follow in order to achieve the best possible outcome, the process is rarely completely linear. It is important for the developer to remain flexible and have the capacity to problem solve and think on their feet at all times, as at any point plans can go awry.

While the process may vary slightly from project to project, in essence all property developments must go through the following stages;
</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-purchase</li>
<li>Concept stage</li>
<li>Purchase</li>
<li>Town planning</li>
<li>Working drawing and documentation</li>
<li>Pre-construction</li>
<li>Construction</li>

<li>Completion and Post Construction</li>
</ol>
<p>classThe nature and magnitude of a property development often compels the constant repositioning of one or more aspects of the concept in a developerâ€™s mind and/or renegotiation between the developer and other participants in the process.
